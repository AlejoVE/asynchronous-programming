## Assignments

> Before getting started on the homework, take a minute to set up your [Homework Issue](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission#homework-issues) on this module's project board.

### Exercises

#### Isolating JavaScript

Solve each exercise on a separate branch and merge to master when they are complete.  Be sure to run `$ node review.js` before pushing to make it easier for your coaches to review your work.

* [Fetching Data](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/fetching-data)

#### Integrating JavaScript

* Form a group of 2-3 and Complete 1 [JavaScript 30](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/javascript-30) group challenge, your choice!
  * Link to your team's main repository in your homework issue

#### Suggested Study

* [async/await](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+async+await+javascript&atb=v214-2__&iar=videos&iax=videos&ia=videos)

<!-- ### Project: `budget-app`

> [project type](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to study the [budget-app tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_HJ3juuFvo) from FCC.  You will build a more complex project that uses classes

You will be expected to turn in your code from his tutorial on a new repository called `budget-app`.  This should be a complete project repository including:

* A `development-strategy.md` file to explain how you built the app in small pieces (this file doesn't need to match the tutorial!)
* One branch per step in your `development-strategy.md`
* The final tutorial code refactored into a well-thought-out folder structure
* A project board & issues to track your progress through your development strategy
* A live demo
* A complete README

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, the organization of your code, and the completeness of your README. -->
